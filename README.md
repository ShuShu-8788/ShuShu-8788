I have experience in building CRUD applications, integrating authentication and authorization, and using advanced queries and patterns in MongoDB, as well as designing systems and models for scalability and efficiency.

Apart from my tech skills, I have a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, including Arrays, Strings, Loops, Multidimensional Arrays, Recursion, and various sorting and searching techniques.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and experimenting with new technologies. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
